# School Nextbots (aka Scratch Nextbots School Edition)
a remixed version of [Scratch Nextbots](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/927726453) made by [yeetyourfoots](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/yeetyourfoots). The remixed version is made by [gyattman96420](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/gyattman96420), aka one of my friends, which is now hosted on github. It features my other friends (and me) in the game as nextbots. (try to survive lol)
